Empirical Software Design: When & Why

Since the publication of Parnas' "On the Criteria to Be Used in Decomposing Systems into Modules" we have had good advice on how to design software. However, most software is more difficult to change than it should be and that friction compounds over time. The Empirical Design Project seeks to resolve the seemingly-irresolvable tradeoff between short-term feature progress and long-term optionality, focusing on:

    How is software actually designed? What can we learn from data about how software is designed?
    When should software design decisions be made? What is the optimal moment given unclear and changing information & priorities?
    How can we enhance the survival of software projects while expanding optionality?

 
Spoiler alert: make design decisions later and in small, safe steps.

Smart Technology, Fair Finance - The Promise and Risks of AI for Sustainable Development

As digital technologies and artificial intelligence reshape global economies, the need for responsible AI governance and inclusive standards has become urgent, and digital innovations risk deepening divides or reinforcing inequities. On this topic, ACM has organized "Smart Technology, Fair Finance - The Promise and Risks of AI for Sustainable Development" at the International Conference on Financing for Development, 30 June – 3 July 2025, Seville, Spain. This session will explore strategic investments in digital infrastructure, ethical AI deployment, climate-smart technologies, and the risks of digital exclusion and unintended harms when AI and digital systems are poorly governed.
ACM Reaffirms Its Commitment to Our Mission and Core Values

ACM is aware that many in our community are concerned about potential negative effects of recent Executive Orders by the new US Administration on our work in both the US and globally. This includes concerns about possible consequences for ACM publishing, conferences, education, and practitioner efforts, as well as concerns about possible harms to our work on inclusion for a strong and diverse technology workforce.

ACM reaffirms its commitment to our mission and core values in all our scientific and educational activities. This includes global scientific and educational efforts dedicated to advancing the art, science, engineering, and application of computing. We will continue to serve both professional and public interests by fostering the open exchange of information and by promoting the highest professional and ethical standards.

ACM’s commitment to its mission, guided by its core values, is unchanged. We will work with members of the community to understand how new Executive Orders may affect their work as it relates to scientific, educational, and community development efforts.

Communications of the relaunched
CACM Relaunched as Open Access, Web-First Publication

ACM has relaunched Communications of the ACM (CACM) as a web-first publication, accessible to all without charge—including the entire backlog of CACM articles. First published in 1958, CACM is one of the most respected information technology magazines. The web-first model will allow ACM to publish articles more rapidly than before so that readers can keep abreast of the lightning-fast changes in the computing field. At the same time, researchers will be able to reference and cite valuable information and research from CACM articles more quickly. This marks another important milestone in ACM's ongoing transition to a fully open access publisher.
A Rewarding Line of Work

In this article from the June issue of Communications of the ACM, Neil Savage delivers a comprehensive overview of the careers and accomplishments of 2024 ACM A.M. Turing Award recipients Andrew G. Barto and Richard S. Sutton. From their separate beginnings in the computer sciences, to their meeting and collaboration on a research project at the University of Massachusetts, and their ultimate development of the modern field of reinforcement learning (RL)—a key method in artificial intelligence (AI) that trains neural networks by offering them rewards, much like the chemical boost that neurons get from doing something positive. It is that work which earned Barto and Sutton the "Nobel Prize in Computing."

Program Merge: What's Deep Learning Got to Do with It?

If you regularly work with open-source code or produce software for a large organization, you're already familiar with many of the challenges posed by collaborative programming at scale. And the scale of the problem has gotten much worse. This is what led a group of researchers at MSR (Microsoft Research) to take on the task of complicated merges as a grand program-repair challenge—one they believed might be addressed at least in part by machine learning. To understand the thinking that led to this effort and then follow where that led, Erik Meijer and Terry Coatta spoke with three of the leading figures in the MSR research effort, called DeepMerge
Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto
Developing the Foundations of Reinforcement Learning

The examples are nothing if not relatable: preparing breakfast, or playing a game of chess or tic-tac-toe. Yet the idea of learning from the environment and taking steps that progress toward a goal apparently was under-studied when 2024 ACM A.M. Turing Award recipients Andrew G. Barto and Richard S. Sutton took on the topic in the late 1970s. Eventually, their research led to the creation of reinforcement learning algorithms that sought not to recognize patterns but maximize rewards. In this Q&A from the June issue of Communications of the ACM, Barto and Sutton speak about how it all unfolded, and what’s next for the techniques that are so celebrated for their success in AlphaGo and AlphaZero.

Systems Correctness Practices at Amazon Web Services

ACM Queue’s "Research for Practice" serves up expert-curated guides to the best of computing research, and relates these breakthroughs to the challenges that software engineers face every day. In this installment, Marc Brooker and Ankush Desai look at how Amazon Web Services (AWS) strives to deliver reliable services that customers can trust completely. This requires maintaining the highest standards of security, durability, integrity, and availability—with systems correctness serving as the cornerstone for achieving these priorities. They highlight the approach for ensuring the correctness of critical services that have since become among the most widely used by AWS customers.
